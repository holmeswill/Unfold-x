=== EXAMPLES

This is a short description of the examples. 
In the subdirectories, BC stands for base cell and SC stands for supercell.

To plot the results with gnuplot use the following commands:

cd example_dir/SC
grep -A1 set unfold_out_file.out > plot.gnu
gnuplot -persist plot.gnu

you can also superimpose the BC band structure by adding

replot '../BC/Fe.bands.dat' u 1:2:($2*0) w p ps 0.5

to plot.gnu.

WARNING: since all the examples deal with supercells it can take up to 
several hours to run them on a standard laptop.
