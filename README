=> IMPORTANT INFO

The code is also available on bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/bonfus/unfold-x

=> INTRODUCTION

This is a simple code to unfold band structures of first-principles 
supercell calculations using the method described in Phys. Rev. B 85, 085201 (2012).

=> INSTALL

Go to the root directory of the QE distribution and configure
the code if you have not done so already:

    cd /path/to/espresso-6.5
    ./configure --some-options

Next move to the path where 'unfold.x' has been extracted and build with:

    cd unfold
    make QE_ROOT=/path/to/espresso-6.5

This will create two executable files in the `bin` directory:
unfold.x and unklist.x

=> INPUT

See comments in examples' input.


=> USAGE

1) Run supercell scf calculation.
2) Define a path in the basecell (big BZ!) reciprocal space and write it 
   using card UNKPTS (same options as in K_POINTS card, but for 'Gamma')
3) Use TRMAT card to define the relationship between the base cell and 
   the supercell (see examples for details).
4) Use unklist.x to produce the k-points for the supercell 'bands' calculation. 
   The k-points are printed to stdout.
5) run a 'bands' calculation with k-points from 4) (remember to use
   wf_collect=.true.)
   Alternatively, if you didn't use symreduce=.true. in 4), you can run 
   a nscf with noinv=.true. and nosym=.true. .
6) run unfold.x
7) Plot the results with gnuplot (command given in output).


=> TOOLS

A python script to parse P_Km binary files is included.

=> NSFAQ (Not so frequently asked questions)

These are the problems that I encountered while testing the code.

* Error: 
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
     from davcio : error #        10
     error while reading from file
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

** Sol. : Set wf_collect=.true.

* Error: kpoint calculated but not found during unfolding

** Sol.1: Write k points with more figures!
** Sol.2: You messed up symmetry. For example, if you run a nscf with
          noinv and nosym, symmetry information are lost and when you 
          run unfold.x it complains about missing k-points because
          it cannot use symmetry to reduce the number of k-points anymore.
